# mean-develoment-book
(WIP) Working through the MEAN Web Development book Amos Haviv and PACKT Publishing 

You probably aren't that interested in looking at this, unless you want to see how I work through the book. 

## Requirements

Requires MongoDB and Node.js.
## How to run

As of version/chapter 7, you must run 'mongod' to run the mongoDB server, then simply run

```
npm start
```

to run the server. By default, it runs on localhost:3000.
